As a software engineer, I believe human life can be better by using technology to solve peopleâ€™s necessities. I developed a love for programming through my journey studying remotely at BrainStation, the idea that you can build anything with Javascript makes me reinforce my philosophy that NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. I used to enjoy building robots and spaceships with whatever I had in my hands when I was a kid and I see programming as "legos for adults". When I am not at my desk building or studying, I am mountain biking or snowboarding in Whistler where I also instruct these two disciplines. Being able to teach extreme sports and also use my brain to solve problems keeps my body and mind sharp.
